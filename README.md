# üìÑ Invoice OCR App for ERPNext v15 (Enhanced Fork)

This repository offers a significantly improved version of the Invoice OCR tool, originally created by [Mohtashim-1](https://github.com/Mohtashim-1/Invoice-OCR) and later enhanced by [Tariquaf](https://github.com/Tariquaf/Invoice-OCR). It automates data extraction from scanned PDF or image invoices and creates Sales or Purchase Invoices in ERPNext using OCR.

## üöÄ What's New in This Fork

- üîÅ Support for both Tesseract and optional PaddleOCR
- üßæ Smarter parsing with improved line-item and metadata extraction
- üåç Multi-language OCR (including Urdu, Arabic, etc.)
- üñºÔ∏è Advanced image preprocessing (deskewing, denoising, etc.)
- üì§ Flexible export options (JSON, CSV, or direct ERPNext integration)
- üß± Modular, extensible codebase with better logging and error handling

## üß† Core Logic Overview

The `invoice_upload-2.py` script defines a Frappe DocType `InvoiceUpload` that:

- Extracts text from uploaded PDFs or images using `pytesseract`
- Parses invoice data: number, date, totals, line-items
- Auto-creates draft Sales/Purchase Invoices in ERPNext
- Handles file processing errors with graceful logging
